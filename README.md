| Daily Quests       | You will be given a questboard every day to complete based off of your real-life tasks, and Unbind will help you keep track and manage them.                                                                      |
| Quest Creation     | AI will automatically convert your tasks into a deck of quests.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Swiping Actions    | **Swipe Right:** Accept quest & block distractions. **Swipe Left:** Reject quest & move onto the next task. **Swipe Up:** Reshuffle the quest back into the deck for later. **Swipe Down:** Regenerate the quest. |
| App Blocking       | Block desired apps, webpages, and .exes across all devices until certain conditions are reached.                                                                                                                  |
